# Hi, I’m Emilia 👋

I build mobile apps in **Flutter/Dart** — from clean UI to **offline-first** data flows and production-ready architecture.
My main focus is **healthcare/medtech** and real-world apps that must be reliable, fast, and usable.

## What I work on
- **Mobile apps (Flutter/Dart):** feature-first structure, state management, UX-focused screens
- **Offline-first & sync:** local persistence + sync queues, retries/backoff, conflict-aware updates
- **Backend integration:** REST APIs / Supabase (auth, DB, storage), data modeling
- **Python tooling:** data processing, CSV/ETL pipelines, validation scripts, small automations for product/data workflows

## Featured projects
### MedPharm Pain Assessment App
Clinical pain tracking (VAS/NRS), enrollment flow, **gamification module**, and **offline-first** storage with syncing.
Repo: `MedPharmApp_lib`

### MediLyze (in progress)
Drug interaction & medication support app tailored for the Polish market (drug/disease database + user-friendly warnings).

### Zaczątek App (in progress)
Multi-location business management app (inventory, staff hours, internal announcements, analytics) built for real restaurant operations.
